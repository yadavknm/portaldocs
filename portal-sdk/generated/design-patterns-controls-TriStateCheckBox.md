### When to use

To select a **single option** among existing values.  Choose the control best suited to your needs
* **CheckBox** - a choice to opt in to a single choice.  For example, use a CheckBox for "I agree" instead of a different control where the user chooses between "I agree" and "I don't agree".
* **DropDown** - a single choice between a large number of options.  The DropDown control is also used on a smaller set of options where the default option is recommended for most users.  The DropDown control can also be used to make multiple selections from a set of options.
* **OptionsGroup** - a single choice between 2-4 equally weighted options where the options names are short.  For example, if the choices are On/Off, Yes/No, or None/Basic/Advanced an option group will work well.  
* **RadioButtons** - a single choice between 2-7 equally weighted options where the option names are long.   
* **TriStateCheckBox** - can be checked, not checked or partially checked to indicate the checked state of children items in a hierarchy.
