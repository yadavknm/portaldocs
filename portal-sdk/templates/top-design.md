# Design Guidelines

These design guidelines provide solutions for common scenarios in Azure.  We formalize these best practices once several teams have a similar problem, use a well researched shared approach, and see successful real-world usage of the common solution. Azure teams should leverage these design guidelines to accelerate extension development and to provide users with a familiar experience so that users can easily adopt new Azure services.

## Controls design guidance
Controls are the building blocks of the Azure UX. They allow users to view, edit, and analyze data. Using built in controls provides consistency across the portal. Additionally, issues around usability, accessibility, security and any other fundamentals are handled by the Framework team.

## Design patterns 
Design patterns provide guidance for common Azure scenarios.

### Resource management patterns
The resource management patterns provide guidance for managing the full lifecycle of Azure resources.

* [Create a resource](design-patterns-resource-create.md)

* [Browse resources](design-patterns-resource-browse.md)

* [Manage a resource](design-patterns-resource-manage.md)

### Page design patterns
The page patterns provide guidance for common page layouts in Azure.

* [Full screen navigation](design-patterns-page-fullscreen.md)

* [Responsive pages](design-patterns-page-responsive-design.md)

* [Page with lists](design-patterns-page-grid.md)

* [Forms](design-patterns-page-forms.md)

* [Filtering](design-patterns-page-filtering.md)

* Quick tips on page design 
    * Pages should be full screen so that we avoid partial pages and avoid horizontal scrolling
    * Content on a page should be constrained to a maximum width of 700px
    * Each page that is displaying data should have a **Refresh** command

## Design templates, toolkits and resources
Design templates, toolkits and resources are available so that you can easily create designs that leverage these patterns.

* [Design templates and toolkits](design-patterns-toolkits.md)

* [Style guide](design-patterns-style-guide.md)

* [Icons](design-patterns-icons.md)

## Writing guides
Writing guides are key resources to brand voice and content style and standards for Azure and the Business Applications Group within the Cloud + AI division. These two guides supply quick answers and essential direction for anyone who creates content — whether for brand naming, product design, documentation, marketing, PR, events, or other customer communications.
